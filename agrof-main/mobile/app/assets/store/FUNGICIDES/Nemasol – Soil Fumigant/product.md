# Nemasol – Soil Fumigant

## Overview
Nemasol is a soil fumigant for the control of soil fungi and nematodes in agricultural soils and seedbeds. Nemasol is a soil disinfectant which gives effective control of fungi and nematodes prior to crop seeding or planting. When it comes into contact with wet soil, Metam sodium decomposes into Methyl iso thiocyanate, a gas which is the active substance. Metam Sodium acts quickly after application, decomposes and does not damage or leave residue in the planted field.

## Specifications
Active Ingredient: Metam Sodium 510g/L
Formulation: Water miscible soil fumigant
Mode of Action: Soil fumigant
Target Pests: Soil fungi (Fusarium, Pythium, Rhizoctonia, Pyrenochaeta, Sclerotium spp.) and nematodes (Meloidogyne spp, Pratylenchus spp, Trichodorus spp.)
Application Method: Soil drenching
Packaging: 60L container

## Key Features
Effective control of soil fungi and nematodes
Quick action after application
No residue left in planted field
Water miscible formulation
Broad spectrum soil pest control
Safe for subsequent crop planting

## Usage Instructions
**Pre-treatment preparations:**
- Prepare the surface to be treated up to a depth of 40-50 cm
- Remove undecayed organic matter
- Bring soil moisture to field capacity at least 14 days before application
- Keep the soil moist up to application time

**Application:**
- Do not apply when soil temperature is below 10°C
- For optimal efficacy, apply when soil temperatures are between 10°C and 25°C
- Mix 13-18mls/20ltrs of water and apply at a rate of 650-900ltrs/Ha

**Post-treatment procedure:**
- Seal treated areas with either follow-up irrigation or plastic sheet to prevent excessive evaporation
- Aerate treated area thoroughly 2-3 weeks after application by cultivating the soil
- Lower soil temperatures (less than 16°C) and soils with clay and organic matter content will retain more Nemasol and therefore require a longer waiting period

## Application Method
Soil Drenching: Apply by drenching infected soils with prepared solution

## Benefits
Effective control of soil-borne diseases
Reduces nematode populations
Improves soil health
No chemical residues
Safe for beneficial soil organisms
Cost-effective soil treatment
