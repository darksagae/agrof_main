## Mode of Action
**Thiamethoxam:** Interferes with the receptor protein nicotinic and acetyl choline of the nervous system. It has contact, stomach and systemic activity.

**Metalaxyl-M:** Penetrates the seed coat and is systemically translocated to both shoots and roots during germination, providing protection from pre-emergence damping-off caused by pythium spp.

**Difenoconazole:** Systemic triazole fungicide with a broad spectrum anti-fungal activity. It is taken up by the seed and translocated within the seedling.
