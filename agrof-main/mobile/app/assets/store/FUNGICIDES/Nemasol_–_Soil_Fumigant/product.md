# Nemasol â€“ Soil Fumigant

## Supplier
Uganda Crop Care Limited

## Overview
Nemasol is a soil fumigant for the control of soil fungi and nematodes in agricultural soils and seedbeds.
Nemasol is a soil disinfectant which gives effective control of fungi and nematodes prior to crop seeding or planting. When it comes into contact with wet soil, Metam sodium decomposes into Methyl iso thiocyanate, a gas which is the active substance. Metam Soidium acts quickly after application, decomposes and does not damage or leave residue in the planted field.

## Active Ingredient
Metam Sodium 510g/L

## Direction for Use
Nemasol is a water miscible soil fumigant and is applied by drenching infected soils. Do not apply Nemasol when soil temperature are below 100C. For optimal efficacy, apply when soil temperatures are between 100C and 250C. Sub-optimal efficacy of Nemasol may occur on turf soils due to insufficient water penetration and soils with high organic matter content (high absorption coefficient).
Pre-treatment preparations: Prepare the surface to be treated up to a depth of 40-50 cm and remove undecayed organic matter. Bring soil moisture to field capacity and at least 14 days before application and keep the soil moist up to application time.
Post- treatment procedure: To prevent excessive evaporation, seal treated areas with either follow-up irrigation or plastic sheet Aerate treated area thoroughly. 2-3 weeks after application by cultivating the soil. Lower soil temperatures (less than 160C) and soils with clay and organic matter content will retain more Nemasol and therefore require a longer waiting period.
Note: Ensure the treated area is ready for use by conducting Germination test.
