## Mode of Action
Metalaxyl-M is a systemic fungicide which is rapidly taken up by the green plant part (within 30 min.) transported upwards in the sap stream and is distributed thus provides control of fungi from within the plant. Chlorothalonil provides a protective film over plant surfaces hence inhibits germination of the spores.
