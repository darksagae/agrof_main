## Overview
Cinnamon plant foliage is generally a glossy green to yellow-green, and they produce small flowers. Both the bark and leaves are aromatic It's inner bark can also be used to make the spice. Cinnamon generally has a slow to moderate growth rate and can be planted in the spring or early fall. Cinnamon is used to flavor a variety of foods, from confections to curries to beverages, and is popular in bakery products. Essential oil can be distilled from the bark fragments for use in food, liqueur, perfume, and drugs.

## Gardening Tips
• When planting, make sure to leave enough space for the mature size of your plant. Choose a site several feet away from other trees and shrubs, so your cinnamon plant will get enough light. Dig a hole to the size of your plant's root ball, and amend the soil with compost. Plant the cinnamon, gently press down the soil, and water it well.
• Cinnamon plants prefer a rich, well-draining soil. A sandy loam will work well. They don't do well sitting in waterlogged soils, and thus heavy clay or hardpan soils are not a recipe for success.
