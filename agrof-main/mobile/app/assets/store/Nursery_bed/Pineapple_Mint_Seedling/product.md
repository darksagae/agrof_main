## Overview
Pineapple Mint is an herbaceous perennial plant commonly grown as a culinary herb. Like most mints, pineapple mint is a creeping plant that spreads from shallow underground rhizomes. Clumps grow 2 to 3 feet tall, and unlimited in width. The aromatic, opposite leaves are oval to oblong. The soft, furry leaves are crinkled and have hairs on both upper and lower surfaces, with downy undersides. Supposedly the leaves have a pineapple fragrance, although is not particularly strong and is more just somewhat sweet and fruity. The foliage tends to remain dense right to the ground, not dropping its lower leaves like many other mints. Pineapple mint typically has pale green leaves margined with cream. The cream and green variegation is quite variable, however, ranging from all-white to solid green and everything in between. It can be used as a tasty topping for fruit, ice cream, cold and hot tea, and juice drinks. Pineapple Mint offer a pleasing pineapple flavor that makes a nice addition to fruit cups, teas and punches when using fresh-cut leaves or, they may be dried for use in sachets.

## Gardening Tips
Pineapple mint does best in full sun in cool climates (but needs some shade in hotter climates or the leaves will burn; in mild climates it will sprawl and flop over in too much shade), and tolerates all types of moist soil. It needs consistent moisture to look its best but becomes floppy in rich soils or when fertilized much, so is good planted in lean soil. Removing old, woody plants to allow new stems to fill in will keep it looking its best. Cut the foliage back to the ground at the end of the season.
They do great in containers. Pollinators love the flowers
