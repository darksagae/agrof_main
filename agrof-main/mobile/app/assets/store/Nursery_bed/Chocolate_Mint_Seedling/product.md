## Overview
Chocolate mint plants are attractive, fragrant and easy to grow. The plant grows to about 2 feet tall and easily spreads by rhizomes into an attractive ground cover. The rounded, lance-shaped leaves are a darker green than other forms of mint. This plant is a vigorous grower. In cooking, chocolate mint can be used for flavoring desserts and drinks. In landscapes, this fast-growing perennial is often naturalized as a ground cover in moist areas or planted in rain gardens. The plant will spread as far as it is allowed, though it is not particularly hard to keep within its boundaries.

## Gardening Tips
• Chocolate mint prefers moist, woods-like soil, so it's good to add some organic matter before planting.
• Mint is one of the few culinary herbs that prefer part shade. You can grow it in full sun if you provide adequate moisture.
