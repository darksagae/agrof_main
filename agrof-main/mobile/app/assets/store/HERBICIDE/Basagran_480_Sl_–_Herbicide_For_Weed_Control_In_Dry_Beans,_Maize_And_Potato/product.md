# Basagran 480 Sl â€“ Herbicide For Weed Control In Dry Beans, Maize And Potato

## Supplier
Uganda Crop Care Limited

## Overview
Basagran 480 SL is a post-emergence Herbicide for the control of Broad leaf weeds in dry beans, maize and potato.

## Active Ingredient
Bentazone 480 g/l

## Mode of Action
The active ingredient is taken up through the green parts of the plant. The leaves and stems must therefore be adequately wetted with the spray solution. Warmth and good growing weather accelerate the action of the product. Basagran 480 SL is sprayed post emergence, i.e., when the weeds have already emerged. After treatment no rain should fall for six hours, so that the active ingredient can penetrate the weeds. Basagran 480 SL has no biologically active vapour pressure and so constitutes no risk to neighbouring crops in this way.

## Directions for Use
