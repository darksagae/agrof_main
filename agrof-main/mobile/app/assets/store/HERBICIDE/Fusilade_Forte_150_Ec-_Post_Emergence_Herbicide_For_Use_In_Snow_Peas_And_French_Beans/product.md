## Supplier
Uganda Crop Care Limited

## Overview
Fusilade Forte is a superior post emergence grass weed herbicide which is used in fruits and vegetables. Fusilade Forte is applied when weeds are between 2- 8 leaf stage. Fusilade Forte kills all germinated Grass weeds and is able to select a wide variety of vegetables and fruits.

## Active Ingredient
Fluazifop-p-butyl 150 g/l

## Formulation
Emulsifiable Concentrate (EC)

## Mode of Action
Fusilade Forte is a systemic herbicide which moves from the treated foliage into the shoots, roots, rhizomes, stolons, and growing points of treated grass weeds. Growth of treated grass weeds stops soon after application as Fusilade Forte is rapidly absorbed by green leaves and subsequently translocated throughout the plant where it accumulates at growing points, both above ground and in the roots, rhizomes and stolons. The first symptoms are generally not evident for approximately a week following application. Growing points turn brown and rot; shoot tips can be easily pulled out after 2 to 3 weeks. Young leaves turn yellow or redden soon after this, but more mature leaves may remain green for an extended period. Weed control is usually complete 3 to 5 weeks after application. Fusilade Forte inhibits acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase), the enzyme catalysing the first committed step in de novo fatty acid synthesis.

Apply at a recommended rate of 150ml/20L of water, 1.5l/Ha or 600ml per Acre
