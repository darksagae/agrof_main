## Mode of Action
Once in the plant, fenoxaprop-P-ethyl is quickly converted into the free D + acid fenoxaprop, which inhibits the biosynthesis of fatty acids leading to plant death. For the application in cereal crops, the fenoxaprop–P-ethyl formulation contains the safener mepenpyr-diethyl which absorbed by foliage and in cereals, enhances the rate of metabolism of fenoxaprop P- ethyl to water soluble non-phytotoxic products. No such enhancement is observed in grass weed species.
