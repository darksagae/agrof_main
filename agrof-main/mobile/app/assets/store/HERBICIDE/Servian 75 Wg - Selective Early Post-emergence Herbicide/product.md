## Mode of Action
Taken up through the roots and shoots, upwards via xylem and downwards via phloem. It accumulates in the plant and inhibits the plant enzyme aceto lactate synthate (ALS) which is responsible for purchasing essential Amino acids. The affected weeds cannot therefore maintain proteins for new cells. The whole process is driven by the plant's use of water (transpiration)
