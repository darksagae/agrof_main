## Mode of Action
S-Metolachlor is mainly taken up through the shoots of germinating plants and seedlings. Weeds are therefore killed before emergence, at emergence or shortly after emergence. Root uptake is less pronounced and much lower than shoot uptake. Atrazine can be taken up by roots and leaves of the plants.
