## Precautions
Shake well before use. Replace cap after pouring. Dual Gold 960 EC®️ must be applied in annual crops at time of planting or up to 3 days after planting. In perennial crops establish a weed-free soil surface prior to application either by hand weeding, mechanical cultivation or by the use of contact herbicides. The soil should have a smooth firm surface, free of clods. To ensure good results it is necessary that application is carried out shortly before rain or irrigation, or within 48 hours after good rain but before the crop emerges and before the top layer of the soil is dry again. If rainfall does not occur in time and weeds begin to emerge and develop, a light cultivation must be carried out with a rotary hoe to destroy these weeds and to mix the herbicide into the top 2-3 cm of soil.

## Timing
Dual Gold 960 EC®️ has to be applied pre-emergence to the crops for optimum results.
Pre-plant surface application: Only for minimum tillage or no tillage systems. Dual Gold 960 EC®️ can be applied up to 45 days before planting certain crops.
Pre-planted incorporated (PPi): Apply Dual Gold 960 EC®️ to the soil and incorporate 5 cm of soil within 14 days before planting using a finishing disk, harrow, rolling cultivator or similar implement. Use pre-plant incorporated application when a period of dry weather after application is expected.
