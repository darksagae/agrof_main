## Additional Notes
Butanil-70 kills susceptible weeds by direct contact action. For this reason, thorough coverage of emerged weeds is essential for the best results. Butanil-70 is most effective if applied when susceptible grasses and broadleaf weeds are small and growing actively under favorable soil moisture and weather conditions.
