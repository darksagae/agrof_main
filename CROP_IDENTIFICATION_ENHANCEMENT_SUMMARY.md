## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Enhanced Analysis Prompt**
```javascript
const prompt = `
Analyze this plant image for disease detection AND crop identification.

1. CROP IDENTIFICATION:
   - Identify the specific crop/plant type (e.g., tomato, corn, rice, wheat, etc.)
   - Plant family (e.g., Solanaceae, Poaceae, Fabaceae, etc.)
   - Growth stage (seedling, vegetative, flowering, fruiting, etc.)

2. DISEASE ANALYSIS:
   - Health status (healthy/diseased)
   - Disease type if any (be specific about the disease)
   - Severity level (low/medium/high)
   - Symptoms observed (list all visible symptoms)
   - Affected plant parts (leaves, stems, roots, etc.)

3. TREATMENT & PREVENTION:
   - Treatment recommendations (practical steps)
   - Prevention strategies
   - Confidence score (0.0 to 1.0)
`;
```

### **Enhanced JSON Response Format**
```json
{
  "crop_type": "specific crop name (e.g., tomato, corn, rice)",
  "plant_family": "botanical family name",
  "growth_stage": "seedling/vegetative/flowering/fruiting/mature",
  "health_status": "healthy" or "diseased",
  "disease_type": "specific disease name" or "none",
  "severity_level": "low", "medium", or "high",
  "symptoms": ["list", "of", "symptoms"],
  "affected_parts": ["list", "of", "affected", "parts"],
  "recommendations": ["list", "of", "treatment", "recommendations"],
  "prevention": ["list", "of", "prevention", "strategies"],
  "confidence": 0.0 to 1.0
}
```

  marginTop: 8,
},
cropType: {
  fontSize: 18,
  fontWeight: 'bold',
  color: '#2E7D32',
  marginBottom: 4,
},
plantFamily: {
  fontSize: 14,
  color: '#666',
  marginBottom: 2,
},
growthStage: {
  fontSize: 14,
  color: '#666',
  fontStyle: 'italic',
},
```
