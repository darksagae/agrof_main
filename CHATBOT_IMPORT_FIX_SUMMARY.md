# Chatbot Import Fix Summary

## 🐛 Problem
The chatbot was showing the error:
```
❌ Chatbot error: [TypeError: Cannot read property 'sendMessage' of undefined]
```

## 🔍 Root Cause
The issue was with ES6 module imports in React Native. The `ChatbotService` was not being imported correctly, causing `ChatbotService.sendMessage` to be undefined.

## ✅ Solution
Created a `ChatbotWrapper` service that provides better compatibility with React Native's module system:

### Files Modified:
1. **`agrof-main/mobile/app/services/chatbotWrapper.js`** - New wrapper service
2. **`agrof-main/mobile/app/components/ChatBot.js`** - Updated to use wrapper

### Key Changes:
- Created `ChatbotWrapper` that properly handles the service import
- Added comprehensive error checking and logging
- Maintained the same API interface for easy integration

## 🧪 Testing
The wrapper includes:
- Service availability checks
- Method existence validation
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Fallback error handling

## 🚀 Result
The chatbot should now properly connect to the Gemini API and provide intelligent responses instead of falling back to the local knowledge base.

## 📝 Next Steps
1. Test the chatbot in the mobile app
2. Verify Gemini API responses
3. Monitor console logs for any remaining issues
4. Deploy the updated chatbot to production
