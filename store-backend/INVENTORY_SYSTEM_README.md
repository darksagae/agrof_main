# üå± AGROF Inventory Management System

## Overview

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive long-term inventory management system for your fertilizer store to address the excess products issue. The system includes automated inventory tracking, barcode scanning, reporting, and analytics.

## üöÄ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Database Schema**
- Added inventory tracking fields to the products table:
  - `quantity_in_stock` - Current stock levels
  - `minimum_stock_level` - Reorder threshold
  - `maximum_stock_level` - Maximum capacity
  - `barcode` - Unique product identification
  - `supplier_name` & `supplier_contact` - Supplier information
  - `cost_price` & `selling_price` - Pricing data
  - `last_restocked_date` - Restock tracking
  - `location` - Warehouse location

### 2. **New Database Tables**
- `inventory_transactions` - Track all stock movements
- `stock_alerts` - Low stock and out-of-stock notifications
- `suppliers` - Supplier management

### 3. **Inventory Management API Endpoints**
- `GET /api/inventory/status` - View all inventory
- `GET /api/inventory/alerts` - View stock alerts
- `POST /api/inventory/update-stock` - Update product stock
- `GET /api/inventory/analytics` - View analytics dashboard
- `GET /api/inventory/transactions` - View transaction history
- `POST /api/inventory/generate-barcodes` - Generate barcodes
- `GET /api/inventory/scan/:barcode` - Scan barcode

### 4. **Automated Inventory Management**
- **Low Stock Detection**: Automatically detects when products fall below minimum levels
- **Reorder Suggestions**: Generates purchase orders for low stock items
- **Stock Alerts**: Creates notifications for urgent restocking needs
- **Daily Automation**: Simulates sales and updates stock levels

### 5. **Comprehensive Reporting System**
- **Inventory Reports**: Complete overview of all products
- **Reorder Reports**: Items needing restocking with cost calculations
- **Sales Analysis**: Track product performance and revenue
- **Supplier Reports**: Monitor supplier performance
- **CSV Export**: Export data for external analysis

### 6. **Barcode Scanning System**
- Generate unique barcodes for all products
- Scan barcodes to quickly update stock
- Track inventory movements via barcode scanning

### 7. **Web Dashboard**
- Real-time inventory dashboard at `/inventory`
- Visual analytics and charts
- Stock update interface
- Alert management system

## üìä Key Features to Address Excess Products

### **Duplicate Product Management**
- Identified 84 fertilizer products with potential duplicates
- System can consolidate similar products (e.g., "NPK 17-17-17" vs "Npk 171717")
- Standardized naming conventions

### **Pricing Consistency**
- 70.2% of products lacked proper pricing
- System now tracks both cost and selling prices
- Automated pricing suggestions based on markup

### **Inventory Optimization**
- Set minimum and maximum stock levels for each product
- Automated reorder points prevent overstocking
- Real-time stock level monitoring

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use the System

### **1. Start the Enhanced Server**
```bash
cd /home/darksagae/Desktop/saga/agrof1/store-backend
npm start
```

### **2. Access the Inventory Dashboard**
Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:3001/inventory`

### **3. Initialize Stock Levels**
```bash
# Run the initialization script
node startup-inventory.js
```

### **4. Generate Barcodes**
Use the dashboard or API to generate barcodes for all products:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/inventory/generate-barcodes
```

### **5. Update Stock Levels**
Use the dashboard interface or API:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/inventory/update-stock \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "productId": 1,
    "quantity": 50,
    "transactionType": "IN",
    "notes": "Initial stock"
  }'
```
